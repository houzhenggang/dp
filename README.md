DNS-Proxy
=========
Modern websites use Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to speed up delivery of static content. However, we show that DNS-based load-balancing of CDN servers fails to fully deliver on the speedup of CDNs. We propose DNS-Proxy (dp), a client process that divides CDN load-balancing functionality between clients and CDNs by choosing from among resolved CDN servers based on last-mile network performance. Our measurement study shows that dp reduces webpage load time by 29%. If dp has already resolved the domain, the reduction in webpage load time is 37%. Finally, dp reduces the download time of individual static Web objects by as much as 60%. We argue that dp enables a more effective use of existing content delivery infrastructure and represents a complementary strategy to a continual increase of geographic content availability.
